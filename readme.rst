End-to-End Complaint Tracking:

  GIFT CMS offers a seamless complaint tracking mechanism, initiating from the complainant portal. For instance, if a faculty member reports an electricity issue in their office, the complaint is meticulously tracked through various stages: inspection portal, storeroom for parts, technician assignment, and finally to the accounts office for funds approval.

Inventory Management:

     The system incorporates a thorough Inventory Management module for the university store. It ensures efficient tracking of spare parts, facilitating prompt issue resolution and minimizing downtime.

Machine Learning Integration:

     GIFT CMS leverages Machine Learning algorithms to intelligently categorize complaints based on content. This feature ensures swift and accurate routing of complaints to the relevant department, optimizing the resolution process.

IT Admin Portal:

     In addition to the general complaint management functionality, the system includes a dedicated IT admin portal. This portal caters specifically to 'IT' related complaints, streamlining the reporting and resolution of technology-related issues.

Collaborative Success:

     While leading this project, I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including stakeholders from inspection, storeroom, technical, and accounts departments. The project stands as a testament to my skills in project management, system design, and innovative problem-solving. I am proud to have contributed as a team leader and developer to the creation of a solution that not only addresses immediate challenges but also lays the foundation for a more streamlined and responsive university infrastructure.I spearheaded the development and implementation of `GIFT CMS`, a robust Complaint Management System tailored for the needs of a university environment.
